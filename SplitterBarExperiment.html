TODO:
    Get it working even when you're not dragging on the html element. It won't work at the moment when used normally! DONE
    Add limits so you can't drag too far in either direction. DONE



    Now that limits can be set, should they be set as relative from the left or the right? 
    I like the idea of setting them relative to the right because screen sizes will vary. Something to think about.



    How could this be turned into a plugin? What would a user of the plugin need to do?

    
    They would need to create a container div with a class of splitter-view.
    Inside it they would define the divs with the left and the right classes.

    The height of the splitter view could be set to inherit so that it was the same as
    the container? It worked.
