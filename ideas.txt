For now, get all of the api functions to live in the one file. You'd be able to delete three files.

Maybe come up with a way to generate a modal on the fly based on an object. Iterating over specific types. Good not to do this with a UI...maybe, but see how it goes
and how you might be able to make it customisable enough for it to be acceptable. Or optional.

You do need to get shouts displaying when a project is selected. Again. But this time via MVC stuff. That'll mean turning the shouttable plugin into a view.

Currently a URL is passed to the shouttable plugin.

This should be unnecessary with MVC. Although you don't want to end up loading all items at once since you've created pagination controls.


When you do a load shouts, you'll need to know
    * Which project the shouts are for
    * Which page to load
