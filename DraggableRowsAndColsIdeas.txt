Think of the UI as a whole.

On the left is a button to add a new project. This would add a new column. Use this button for that for now.





On the columns we want:
	* Column type.
	* Project name.
	* Controls
		* Edit project name.
		* Edit list of shouts.



The plugin should have the ability to have these items added to it.
Ensure that the plugin has an addRow() and addColumn() method.
Ensure that the plugin has scrollbars.
Can you easily customise what's displayed?


















Button the the left adds a new column/project.
Don't worry about editing the project name just yet.
Don't worry about editing the list just yet.
